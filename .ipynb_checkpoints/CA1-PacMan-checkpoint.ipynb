In reality, it is probably much more than that as there may be obstacles in the way or the agents may choose to go in opposite directions, etc. This way I calculated the minimum steps required for each fruit to be eaten. Then I found the maximum of these values. This value is the minimum steps needed for the fruit which is furthest from both agents to be eaten.
